IgnoreSlackbot
==============

Tampermonkey script to ignore Slack Bot on [slack.com](https://slack.com/). Slack Bot will no longer show up in any channel, and their messages will be marked as read immediately.

[Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) is a greasemonkey-like extension for Google Chrome, which allows you to add javascript to particular pages.

A very similar script would work in Firefox, with few modifications.
